# Mutli-Classification-Challenge
This project is aims to give a **starting kit** for a Challenge. We decided to study the severity of a car accident based on several factors.

**Starting kit**
- First part of the **starting kit** is an initial study and cleaning of the data we gathered. 
- Second part is a first test of classification from our model.

**Submissions**
- Files in the submission folder were implemented to be able to submit our model on ramp studio. 


The goal of this project was **not** to give a perfect solution to our problem, but rather to propose an interesting challenge for students
to work with.
